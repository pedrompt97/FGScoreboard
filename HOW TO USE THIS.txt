HOW TO USE THIS WITH OBS/XSPLIT

1. Unzip to wherever (doesn't matter).

2. Open StreamControl

3. In StreamControl, click on Settings (the gear icon), the click on Configuration

4. For the XML/JSON Path, click Browse and select the "Overlay" folder.

5. For Layout File, click on Browse, go to the Overlay folder, and select "layout.xml"

6. Leave everything else as it is, then click on Ok.

7. In OBS or Xsplit, drag the "ScoreBoard-jstween.html" file into your scene.

8. Go to the Properties of ScoreBoard-jstween.html in OBS and Xsplit and make sure the resolution is set to 1920 x 1080.*

9. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for "Commentators.html"




*These files are designed for 1920x1080 broadcasts, while OBS will automatically adjust the scene when you manually resize it, 
Xsplit for some reason will not, and you'll have to manually adjust the zoom to compensate
